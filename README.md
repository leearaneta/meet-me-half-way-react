# README

This is a project completed by Lee Araneta and Yichen Yang, two grads from the Flatiron School, June cohort.
We've decided to add new features to the original [Ruby version](https://github.com/leearaneta/meet-me-halfway) shown at Flatiron Presents using React-Redux. Checkout the [demo](https://vimeo.com/185692228) here! :eyes: 

##Meet Me Halfway
Enter you and your friends' addresses (up to 10) to find out where to hangout around your midpoint!
View the different transportation modes and how long it takes for each person to get to the destination at ease.
 

##Built with:
* React.js
* Redux
* Express.js
* FourSquare API
* GoogleMaps API
* React-Geosuggest
* Google Material Design
